Object Detection using TensorFlow.js with Coco SSD Model

# Introduction

This project aims to perform object detection on an image using TensorFlow.js and the Coco Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model. The model is pre-trained on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset and can detect 80 different objects.

#Technical Details

The project uses TensorFlow.js, an open-source library for machine learning in JavaScript, to perform object detection. The Coco SSD model is loaded using the TensorFlow.js API and is used to make predictions on an image.

# Implementation

## The project consists of the following steps:

1. Load the Coco SSD model using the TensorFlow.js API
2. Read an image and pre-process it for prediction
3. Use the model to make predictions on the image
4. Post-process the predictions and display the results on the image
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow.js for object detection tasks and the power of pre-trained models like the Coco SSD. This can serve as a starting point for more advanced projects and further experimentation with different models and techniques.
